# Data Generation

In the notebook `data_generation.ipynb` we show how to generate the data for the examples.
The notebook was run on Google Colab, so you have to upload the notebook on your Google Drive and then open it with Colab.
In the same folder of the notebook you have to upload the file `geometry.py` that contains the functions to generate the geometries.
Then you can follow the instructions in the notebook to generate the data.
